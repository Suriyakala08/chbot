<h2 style="color:green">10 Healty Tips:</h2>
<h4>1.Eat a variety of foods:</h4>
<p>A high-fat lunch could be followed by a low-fat dinner.
    For good health, we need <i style="color:red">more than 40 different nutrients</i>, and no single food can supply them all.</p>
<h4> 2.Base your diet on plenty of foods rich in carbohydrates:</h4><p>About <i style="color:red">half the calories in our diet</i> should come from foods rich in carbohydrates, such as cereals, rice, pasta, potatoes, and bread.It is a good idea to include at least one of these at every meal.</p>
<h4> 3.Replace saturated with unsaturated fat:</h4><p>Fats are important for good health and proper functioning of the body.<i style="color:red">Eating fish 2-3 times a week</i> with at least one serving of oily fish, will contribute to our right intake of unsaturated fats.</p>
<h4>4.Enjoy plenty of fruits and vegetables:</h4><p><i style="color:red">Fruits and vegetables </i>are among the most important foods for giving us enough vitamins, minerals and fibre. We should try to eat at least 5 servings a day.</p>
<h4>5.Reduce salt and sugar intake:</h4><p>A <i style="color:red">high salt intake can result in high blood pressure</i>, and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.Sugar provides sweetness and an attractive taste, but sugary foods and drinks are rich in energy, and are best enjoyed in moderation, as an occasional treat.</p>
<h4>6.Eat regularly, control the portion size:</h4><p><i style="color:red">Eating a variety of foods, regularly, and in the right amounts</i> is the best formula for a healthy diet.Skipping meals, especially breakfast, can lead to out-of-control hunger, often resulting in helpless overeating. Snacking between meals can help control hunger, but snacking should not replace proper meals. </p>
<h4>7.Drink plenty of fluids:</h4><p>Adults need to <i style="color:red">drink at least 1.5 litres</i> of fluid a day! Or more if it's very hot or they are physically active. Water is the best source, of course, and we can use tap or mineral water, sparkling or non-sparkling, plain or flavoured. </p>
<h4>8.Maintain a healthy body weight:</h4><p>Excess body fat comes from eating more than we need. The <i style="color:red">extra calories can come from any caloric nutrient</i> - protein, fat, carbohydrate, or alcohol, but fat is the most concentrated source of energy. </p>
<h4>9.Get on the move, make it a habit!:</h4><p><i style="color:red">Physical activity</i> is important for people of all weight ranges and health conditions. It helps us burn off the extra calories, it is good for the heart and circulatory system, it maintains or increases our muscle mass, it helps us focus, and <i style="color:red">improves overall health</i> well-being. </p>
<h4>10.Start now! And keep changing gradually:</h4><p><i style="color:red">Gradual changes</i> in our lifestyle are easier to maintain than major changes introduced all at once. For three days, we could write down the foods and drinks we consume throughout the day, and make a note of the amount of movement we made.</p>
